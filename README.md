# Apparky-logo-with-turtle


> Our logo is designed with a character of alphabets, where A is designed with python turtle graphics and `PPARKY` as a normal alphabet character. 
> Together set up as [__APPARKY__](https://apparky-soumenmtec-gmailcom.vercel.app/). 
> The cursor in [`turtle-python`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html) is called the [`turtle-pen`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#pen-control) which starts from one point and covers the whole design and comeback to it's starting point. 
> [`Turtle`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html) is a pre-installed [`Python`](https://www.python.org/) library that helps to creates different shapes by providing them with virtual canvas.
